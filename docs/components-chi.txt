RequestNode_F
-------------

The Request Node operates in TLM and consists internally of a TLM traffic
generator coupled with a cache_chi. The traffic generator generates TLM
generic payloads based on a traffic description given at construction of
the RequestNode_F class. The generated generic payloads are then pipelined
into the CHI cache that either processes the transaction if the needed
data already resides in the cache (in the correct state), or generates
required CHI transactions (requests) for fetching the data before
processing.

cache_chi
---------

The cache_chi operates as a writeback cache. The cache generates CHI
transactions as needed when processing incoming TLM generic payloads (if
data already resides in the cache in the required cache state no CHI
transaction will be generated). In it's default mode it generates copyback
write transactions, dataless transactions (CleanUnique, MakeUnique and
Evict) and read transactions resulting in cache line allocation
(ReadShared and ReadUnique). It is also possible to configure the cache to
scramble the generated transactions for transmitting request as
WriteUnique* and ReadOnce* if desired, the result for these transactions
will not be cached.

The cache acts on incoming snoop requests and also replies on DVM snoop
requests.

The cache contains three initiator sockets where it outputs REQ, RSP and
DAT messages described in a TLM generic payload and an attached CHI
attributes tlm extension. The cache also has three target sockets where
incoming RSP, DAT and SNP messages are received (also described in a
generic payload with an CHI attributes extension).

SlaveNode_F
-------------

The SlaveNode_F contains two TLM target sockets where it receives REQ and
DAT messages and also two TLM initiator sockets where it transmits DAT and
RSP messages (all these messages are described with a TLM generic payload
containing an attached CHI attributes extension). Finally it also contains
a TLM initiator socket where the SN-F generates transactions (non CHI)
towards a TLM target socket (TLM module).

Incoming CHI read requests (transactions incoming on the rigth in picture
below) result in a read TLM transaction (non CHI) towards the connected
TLM module (connected to the left in the picture below). Incoming CHI
write transaction result in a write towards the TLM module. Incoming CHI
atomic transactions will be processed with a read and a write towards the
TLM module (AtomicStore only generates a write). CHI dataless transactions
are responded on by the Slave Node (but no TLM transactions is generated
towards the TLM module).

Finally the SN also generates RetryAck and PCrdGrant messages on occation.

iconnect_chi
------------

The iconnect_chi operates in TLM as an HN-F and also contains an MN
handling DVM operations. It contains ports of three different types, of
type Port_RN_F, for connecting RN-Fs, of type Port_CCIX, for generating
and receiving CCIX messages and finally of type Port_SN, for connecting an
SN. The ICN also contains a snoop filter.

The CHI ICN receives request messages from masters, RN-Fs, through the
ports (Port_RN_Fs). If the requests require snooping the ICN will then
look into it's snoop filter to decide which masters, RN-Fs, to snoop (this
is also done through the Port_RN_Fs). If no snooping is required the ICN
will proceed with replying on the transaction as required or generating a
transaction (request) downstream towards the connected slave node.

Finally the ICN also generates RetryAck and PCrdGrant messages on occation
(towards the RN-Fs).

|          |          |             |
 '----------------------------------'

Each Port_RN_F contains three TLM target sockets where reception of REQ,
RSP and DAT messages is done and also three TLM initiator sockets for
transmitting RSP, DAT and SNP messages (all CHI messages are described
with at TLM generic payload with an attached CHI attributes extension).
Received messages are forwarded to and therafter processed by the HN-F/MN.

  '-----------'--------------------->

The port towards the slave node, Port_SN, contains two TLM initiator
sockets where REQ and DAT messages are transmitted and two TLM target
sockets where RSP and DAT messages are received from the SN (as with the
Port_RN_F all CHI messages are described with at TLM generic payload with
an attached CHI attributes extension). Received messages are forwarded to
and therafter processed by the HN-F/MN.

The CCIX ports translate between CHI and CCIX. The ICN routes CHI
transactions based on the configuration in an internal System Address Map
(SAM). When CHI transactions are routed through a CCIX port, the CCIX port
translates the CHI transaction to a CCIX equivalent and outputs the
required CCIX messages through its TLM initiator socket. Similarly, the
CCIX ports translate CCIX transactions incoming through the port's TLM
target socket into CHI transactions (flows).

The CCIX ports also handles CCIX protocol request, data, snoop and misc
credits (both TX and RX credits).

CHI traffic generation
----------------------

For generating CHI traffic against an interconnect a RequestNode_F can be
pipelined with a TLM to CHI bridge. The bridges will then translate the
incoming CHI messages and generate the CHI signal wiggling required.

 .--------------. TLM  .---------------.
| RequestNode_F | <--> | tlm2chi_bridge | ----> CHI signal wiggling
 '--------------'       '---------------'

With the CHI interconnect pipelined to an CHI to TLM bridge CHI snoop
transactions can be generated towards a Request Node. The bridge will then
handle the CHI signal wiggling required of the translated snoop
transactions.

 .--------------------------. TLM   .---------------.
| iconnect_chi  | Port_RN_F | <--> | chi2tlm_bridge | ----> CHI signal
|               '-----------|       '---------------'        wiggling
|                           |
'--------------------------'

Through the CHI interconnect (pipelined into a TLM to CHI bridge of the
type SN) CHI traffic can be generated towards a Slave Node. The bridge
will then handle the CHI signal wiggling required of the translated CHI
messages.

| iconnect_chi  | Port_SN | <--> | tlm2chi_bridge | ----> CHI signal
|               '---------|       '---------------'        wiggling
|                         |
'-------------------------'

CCIX traffic generation
----------------------

CCIX traffic can be generated (or received) by connecting the CCIX port on
the CHI interconnect to a TLM to CXS bridge. The TLM to CXS bridge will
pack (unpack) CCIX messages into (from) TLPs and also handle required CXS
signal wiggling.

| iconnect_chi  | Port_CCIX | <--> | tlm2cxs_bridge | ----> CXS signal
|               '-----------|       '---------------'        wiggling
|                           |
